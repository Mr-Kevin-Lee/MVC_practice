<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>This website was created in order to best learn ASP.NET MVC (3 and onwards) and put these learnings into practice.</p>
<p>As much of the work I'm currently doing professionally revolves around the Microsoft stack, I felt that this practice-space would allow me to become more comfortable and familiar with the environment</p>

<h3>Plans</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A system where users are able to enter and edit text to be displayed on a new page</li>
    <li>Some sort of Dependency Injection exercise</li>
</ul>
